# NLP-notebooks

Jupyter Notebook for various NLP tasks. Some notebooks are hands-on exercises in the IA161 NLP in Practice course taught at FI MUNI.

## Structure

Each notebook from the IA161 contains several tasks. The notebooks can be run as they are. The purpose is to show things, not to limit students who do not know Python.
